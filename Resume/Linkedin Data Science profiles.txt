I have been working in all areas of Speech Recognition and NLP. With a keen interest in Neuroscience & Speech Recognition Systems, I have taken up roles as a researcher in Machine Learning /Deep Learning applications. As a Data and Product analyst, can create vizualisations to explore data, articulate clear findings to drive business decisions, or use data to elicit consensus from diverse perspectives .Looking for contributing in areas of NLP, Computational Linguistics, Information Extraction, Deep Learning , Speech Science.
I enjoy Rapid Prototyping my research ideas to production. Polymath by nature.
Currently , I am working on research projects on Artificial General Intelligence and exploring possible research paths toward building human-level intelligence. Exploring ideas on computational cognitive science, Emotion creation, Cognitive modelling, Human centred AI These Projects will seek to build intuition about the limitations of state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and how those limitations may be overcome
I take my time off seriously and am an avid reader and traveller. I enjoy local cuisines wherever i go and my aim is to cover 30 countries before i turn 30 ! :)
My Research specialities include :
- Deep Learning and Neural Networks
- Natural Launguage processing, Natural Language Understanding
- Machine Translation, Speech Processing, Spoken Interfaces and Dialogue Processing
Connect with me for opportunities on Speech Recognition, Machine learning, Deep learning and its extended applications in diverse fields. I would love to work in these areas for Maximum impact and learning to drive social impact and career growth simultaneously.
NOTE : Due to large number of messages i only respond to those that match my schedule & interests.
