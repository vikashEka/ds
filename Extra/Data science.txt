 Data Science
 Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.[1][2] Data science is the same concept as data mining and big data.
 Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[4] It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science. 
 
 Data analysis 
 Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making.
 
 Machine learning (ML) 
 Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task
 
												NOTE-Quora
												

Even I am preparing for the same, and even I did a lot of research on this so will let you know how to start with it.
Start with Python.
A-Z Hands on Python on Udemy is the best to start with.
It will be better if you could also do data structures and algorithms using Python as that will only make you better.
Once this has been done, A-Z Hands on Data science/Machine learning using R and Python on Udemy will be good to start with Data science basics and advanced.
===================================
Coursera have some good course on Data Science basics which is taught by University of Michigan Profs.
===================================
If you get comfortable with it and want to try some data science before college, sign up for the Free University of Michigan series on Coursera(there are two Python for everyone and Python for Data Analysis)â€¦take your time and go through them both.
===================================
You can use datasets from Kaggle for practise.
===================================
Start with Khan academy for Maths and for ML start with Andrew NG videos at YouTube.
===================================
Applied Data Science with Python (coursera)
University of Michigan
Udemy (Machine learning A-Z)
===================================
Best courses are available online from worlds best professors in the English Language for free.

===================================
Do some data science project on kaggle.
===================================
Khan Academy for maths. Statistics, probabily, matrices etc are very very useful tools for data visualizations, analysis and inferences.
